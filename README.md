### 👩‍🔬 About the Author

I spent many years working in wet lab research, purifying proteins and setting up crystal trays to generate structural biology data. Now, I work at **PDBe**, part of the **Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB)**, where I’ve been learning more about programming and data analysis.

Jupyter Notebooks have been a great way for me to explore, test, and share code in a user-friendly format -- especially for those who are just starting out in computational biology.
